# Coffee-Shop
(on coding) </br></br>
Here I create a coffee shop website where you can order different types of coffee </br>
</br>
The languages used are Python, CSS HTML and JS. In this project, I will focus on learning JS, organise the folders and document my code as well as coding with a good syntax and following the convention for each language. </br>
I will also work on the visual part of the website.
